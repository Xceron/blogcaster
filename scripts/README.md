# Scripts

There are two sections of scripts, the core ones and the "experimental" section.
The core scripts are as follows:
1. `create-config.py`: Parses markdown into a `yml` file.
2. `tts.py`: Queries 11labs to create audio. Merges files and prints chapters.
3. `ttv-generate.py`: Queries DALLE3 to create images.
4. `ttv-merge.py`: Combines audio and images to video file.
